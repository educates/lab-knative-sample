[Knative](https://knative.dev/) is an open source community project which adds components for deploying, running, and managing serverless, cloud-native applications to Kubernetes. The serverless cloud computing model can lead to increased developer productivity and reduced operational costs.

Knative eliminates the tasks of provisioning and managing servers. This lets developers focus on their code without having to worry about setting up complex infrastructure. 

The goal of this workshop is to serve as a base for content creators that want to show the capabilities of Knative and need a basic environment for doing so. Hence, workshop creators should only need to include their content, without worrying about dependencies. The workshop itself comes with an example of how to deploy a basic service, based on Knative's Serving getting started [guide](https://knative.dev/docs/getting-started/first-service/).
